## About this tutorial
Open data is about transparency, accountability and empowerement. By making accessible the data they collect - those that can be shared without harming data subjects - organizations provide information to the public but also opportunities to build systems and applications that can consume it, transform it, repurpose it and eventually make it even more useful for society. 

In the this tutorial, I'm going to present one of the most insightful data source to understand racial inequality in the United States. I'll provide tips to leverage its [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) - i.e. programmatically query the database. I will also provide examples of data visualizations and simple applications we can build on the top of the database. I will provide snipets of [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) code and [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). I will us [**Microsoft PowerBI**](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/), [**Highcharts**](https://www.highcharts.com/) and [**d3.js**](https://d3js.org/) to generate representation to free the insights hidden in this very rich dataset.

To easily share JavaScript code, I'll use [JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).
