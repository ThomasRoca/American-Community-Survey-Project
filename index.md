## About this tutorial
Open data is about transparency, accountability and empowerement. By making accessible the data they collect - those data points that can be shared without harming data subjects - organizations provide information to the public but also opportunities to build systems and applications that consume data, transform it, repurpose it and eventually make it even more useful for society. 

In this tutorial, I'm going to present one of the most insightful sources of data to understand racial inequality in the United States. I'll provide tips to leverage its [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) - i.e. way to programmatically query the database. I will also provide examples of data visualizations and simple applications we can build on the top of the database. I will provide snipets of [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) code and [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript). I will use [**Microsoft PowerBI**](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/), [**Highcharts**](https://www.highcharts.com/) and [**d3.js**](https://d3js.org/) to visualize this information and reveal some of the insights hidden in this very rich dataset.

To easily share JavaScript code, I'll use [JSfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/). 

## About U.S. Census Bureau's [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/about.html)
As put by the U.S. Census Bureau, "the American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides vital information on a yearly basis about our nation and its people. Information from the survey generates data that help determine how more than $675 billion in federal and state funds are distributed each year. Through the ACS, we know more about jobs and occupations, educational attainment, veterans, whether people own or rent their homes, and other topics. Public officials, planners, and entrepreneurs use this information to assess the past and plan the future"
